To exchange the information, the addin and the application must respect the current format.

--------Addin -> Application---------

All the commands are in the form &xx; with x being a character.
This is because of a weird bug within the addin that, for some reason, messes up the bits
after the first 4 characters. Therefore 4 characters long commands must be the maximum.

Here are the different commands. The first character (after the '&') represents the command,
the second character 'X' represents the argument.

Subreddit:

To connect to a specific subreddit, the command is &sX;
Since only one character is allowed the different subs are hardcoded into the addin.
't' = /r/TalesFromTechSupport
'r' = /r/TalesFromRetail
'n' = /r/NoSleep
'c' = /r/Caddit
'a' = /r/AskReddit
'v' = viedemerde.fr (to be implemented)

Post:

Once the user has selected a post, the addin sends the rank of the post, which is interpreted
by the application as its ID.
The command is &pX; and the rank of the post is in the range A-Y (25 posts is the maximum).

More characters:

Due to the reception buffer limit of 1 ko, if the application sends that the transmission is not yet finished,
the addin sends &ak; once it has finished storing the characters sent.

--------Application -> Addin---------

The data read by the addin must be in some kind of weird custom xml format.

################
NOTE: ALL communications MUST be ended with a quote ("), to inform the addin that the transmission is finished.
Therefore you must replace all quotes (whether backslashed or not) with the 0x81 character.
If you still have data to send, end your communication with a '<' and then a quote.
################

Since < and > are special characters, replace them with 0x7F and 0x80 respectively.
Don't replace them with &gt; and &lt;, they will be displayed as "&gt;" and "&lt;".

Data for posts:

<r subreddit> <p content of post> <p content of second post> ...

You can customise the subreddit attribute and the contents, you can put whatever you want as long as it's not
a quote or a '>'. Example:

<r /r/AskReddit> <p People of Reddit, where are you banned from and why?\n/u/ArtyStickyGuy 3525 upvotes /r/askreddit>

Data for comments:

<t Text+title of post> <1 first level comment> <2 second level comment> <3 third level comment> <1 another first lvl comment>

Basically the post data must be in the <t> tag, and the comments must be in a numbered tag from 1 to 9.
